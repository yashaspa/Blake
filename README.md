My personal assistant that pretty much takes care of everything specific to my life.

## About (please skip if you don't care):
Like it says above, lot of my day to day tasks could be simplified if someone was able to do it before I took a look at it and I could focus on what my skills are really needed for. Hiring an assistant is not something I can afford to do at the moment and the likes of siri or alexa are pretty useless. So using some of the resources I have online, I'm trying to see if how much I could get done with the help of interesting models at huggingface and some existing known foundational models. The further I go the more complex things will get and it'll transition from being a scheduling assistant to basically help making lifestyle decisions.

## Versions and Aspirations:
- Step 1: Scheduling assistant. Basically reads my google calendar and schedules tasks and other meetings.
- Step 2 and further: Still deciding. 

## Design:
